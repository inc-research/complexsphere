# .github/workflows/publish.yaml
#
# Publishes atmoplex to PyPI automatically when a new release is tagged
# on the main branch (e.g. v1.0.0).
#
# Uses PyPI Trusted Publishing (OIDC) — no API token or password required.
# Setup instructions:
#   1. Go to pypi.org → Your Projects → atmoplex → Publishing
#   2. Add a new Trusted Publisher with these values:
#        Owner:            your-github-username
#        Repository:       atmoplex
#        Workflow name:    publish.yaml
#        Environment name: pypi
