ComplexSphere
Information-Theoretic & Relativistic Climate Dynamics for Python

ComplexSphere is a quantitative physics framework designed to detect non-stationary structural phase shifts in meteorological and climatological data.

Standard Bayesian models and rolling historical averages frequently fail to anticipate complex thermodynamic breakouts (e.g., localized heat traps and grid demand spikes). ComplexSphere solves this by applying principles of Information Geometry, Relativistic Kinetics, and Quantum Information Theory (ER=EPR) to standard weather time-series, allowing researchers to measure the velocity and memory of a regional climate system.
